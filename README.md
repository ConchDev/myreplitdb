## MyReplitDB

- An easy to use wrapper for replit's database system.

## Example

```py
>>> import myreplitdb

>>> db = myreplitdb.Database()
>>> db.insert('test', 'hello!')
>>> db.get('test')

hello!
```

## Notes
- I don't recommend people use this since replit's database is like a dictionary, it's way more easier to use than this *library*.
